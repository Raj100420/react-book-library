## Design Decisions

1. **Component Structure**:
   - Created separate components for Book, BookList, and SearchBar for better code organization and reusability
   - Used clear prop interfaces for type safety and better development experience

2. **State Management**:
   - Used React's useState hook for managing component state
   - Kept state management simple with no external libraries needed for this scale of application

3. **Styling Approach**:
   - Used Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling approach
   - Employed gradient text effects for visual appeal
   - Made sure the design is responsive across different device sizes
   - Used conditional rendering with fade animations for smoother transitions

4. **Search Implementation**:
   - Real-time filtering of books as user types in the search field
   - Filter by both title and author with case-insensitive matching
   - Added clear search functionality for better UX
   - Included an empty state design when no results are found

5. **Accessibility**:
   - Added proper aria-labels for interactive elements
   - Ensured sufficient color contrast for text readability
   - Made interactive elements clearly visible and easy to use

## Future Improvements

- Add sorting options (by title, author, or year)
- Implement book ratings or favorites feature
- Add pagination for larger book collections
- Create categories or tags for better organization
- Add dark mode toggle
